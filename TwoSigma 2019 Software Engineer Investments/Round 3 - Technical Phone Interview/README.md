## 2. Maximum Sum Circular Subarray
----
        
Given a circular array C of integers represented by A, find the maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray of C.       
Here, a circular array means the end of the array connects to the beginning of the array.  `(Formally, C[i] = A[i] when 0 <= i < A.length, and C[i+A.length] = C[i] when i >= 0.)`        
Also, a subarray may only include each element of the fixed buffer A at most once.  `(Formally, for a subarray C[i], C[i+1], ..., C[j], there does not exist i <= k1, k2 <= j with k1 % A.`length = k2 % A.length.)`
