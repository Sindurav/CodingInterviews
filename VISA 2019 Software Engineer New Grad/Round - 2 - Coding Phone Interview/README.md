1. Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).   

Assume a BST is defined as follows:   

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.  
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.  
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.   


2. Follow-up: Generalize your code for n-array tree. Make a N-array tree. Given N-array tree validate that it is a binary search tree (BST).  

3. Follow-up: Optimize your code. I used flag to stop the recursion. Flag is used for early stop.   

4. What is the time complexity and space complexity.   

5. Follow-up: Can you do it iteratively ??
